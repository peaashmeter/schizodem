# Schizodemocracy
## What's this?
A hypothesis on how to generate better results with LLM.
You force one model to act as several personalities, and then to evaluate its own answers.

## How does it work?
Dart language is used for both frontend and backend, making use of [google_generative_ai package](https://pub.dev/packages/google_generative_ai).
All the magic lies in well-prepared prompts.
